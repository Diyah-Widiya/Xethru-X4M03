# Xethru-X4M03
This code for collecting raw data from radar X4M03-Novelda
# Step for collecting data 
Here are the steps that need to be taken to run the program:

1. Create the environment, make sure the Python version used is in the range of 2.7-3.6. If using a different Python version, errors may occur during the installation of pymoduleconnector.
   
2. Ensure that you already have the pymoduleconnector file provided by Novelda.

3. Install pymoduleconnector in the created environment.

4. Run the program Data-Collect.py, make sure to adjust the COM port according to your computer; on my system, it is 'COM17'.
